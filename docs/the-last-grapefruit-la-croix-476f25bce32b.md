简而言之:一家公司倒闭了，50 名员工中的每一个都得到了工作或遣散费，除了一个人:我。我倾向于不写发生在我身上的事情。有什么可写的？我刚刚用 23 个字给你讲了这个故事。我更喜欢写那些摸起来像鱼或鸟的滑溜溜的东西，那些你需要一张网和一些狡猾才能抓住的东西。关于简单发生的事情的故事？这感觉太牛了。你可以把一个螺栓穿过它的头骨，但没有狩猎。

但我还是想写一下这个。它的坚固，它拒绝飞翔，有一些东西触动了我。我的思绪停留在玻璃墙的会议室，盒装晚餐的橙色纸板包装，某些短语的重复。这让我想起了我小时候玩的一个游戏。出于某种原因，我们叫它苔藓，但你可能叫它别的什么。基本上就是在黑暗中捉迷藏。你四处摸索，抓住某人的脚踝，下巴撞到咖啡桌上。父母不喜欢我们玩。而是在黑暗中寻找出路的激动！

有问题的公司是一家“活动发现门房”，这是一款帮助城市年轻人找到早午餐餐馆和安静的迪斯科舞会的应用程序。我是我们西雅图市场的内容主管，尽管我从未去过这个城市。我是变戏法的专家，我从未体验过这些东西:供应红烧鱼唇和百合汤的墙洞点心店，或者是秘密的瑞典欢乐时光，在那里冷熏鲱鱼可以与提神的 aquavit 一起追逐。我们占据了市场街上一栋旧金山历史建筑的二楼。向窗外望去，我们可以看到无家可归的人、自行车道、啄食废弃外卖盒的鸟。有一次，在一个街区外的手提箱里发现了一具被肢解的尸体，街道被封闭了几个小时。

出于安全考虑，公司承担了员工优步晚上 9 点下班后乘车回家的费用。但是我们的好处并不都那么实际。虽然我们没有 401K，但我们每月获得 100 美元的“有趣”积分，用于应用程序上的啤酒配对晚餐、鸡尾酒会和碧昂斯舞蹈课。我们不需要穿公司的 t 恤参加这些活动——上面印有“吃喝玩乐”的字样——但我们大多数人还是穿了。像所有初创公司一样，我们的总部也被装饰成了中世纪的现代风格。入口通道的一面木镶板墙展示了我们蚀刻钢的标志。左边，一堆橡木色的伊姆斯椅围绕着一张矮茶几，铺在蓬松的白色地毯上。在办公室的正中央，有两个芥末色的羊毛双人座椅，靠背延伸得足够高，可以完全隐藏住乘客。它们面对面放置，形成了一个我们称之为“豆荚”的私人空间这个豆荚不像是一个工作场所，更像是一个高中朋友的地下室。希瑟会踢掉她的鞋子，安吉尔编辑他的 Tinder 个人资料，阿尼什和阿米尔用印地语交谈，窃笑。我们无精打采，我们唱歌，我们喝啤酒，我们洒茶。纳达夫有时也在分离舱工作。他坐在他的 Macbook 上，像一个喝醉了的犹太人，他的背挺直，从来没有碰到过座垫。

Nadav 是我们的联合创始人兼首席执行官。他的面部轮廓是极端的，在他的鼻子陡峭而突然地爆发之前，在眉毛之间有一个最低点。大鼻子让一些人看起来笨手笨脚，但纳达夫的鼻子给他一种严肃感。他的一切都是有目的的，沉着的:他剪短了头发，总是穿着同样的制服，斜纹棉布裤，沙漠靴，还有一件按扣衬衫。他可能很严厉；他最喜欢的让房间安静下来的方法是用他的结婚戒指敲击金属凳子。他总是在我们每周全体会议开始时举行结婚戒指仪式。会议的目的是接受纳达夫的教导，并消除任何可能影响公司健康的反叛观念。每周，纳达夫都会发表不同版本的激动人心的演讲，讲述我们不可阻挡的势头。“生活在全球各个城市的数百万年轻人，他们有什么共同之处？”他会问。如果这是你第一次听到这种说法，你可能会猜测答案是像未支付的学生贷款或未确诊的人乳头瘤病毒。但事实并非如此。“从波特兰到匹兹堡的年轻人都在问自己同样的问题，”纳达夫继续说道。“今晚我们该做什么？”年轻、单身的千禧一代不知道钱该花在哪里，这个问题已经到了无以复加的地步，而我们正是帮助他们解决这个问题的公司。听到一款推荐高档餐厅的产品用如此高尚的词语来描述，令人感到不舒服，但 Nadav 字字句句都是认真的。他曾经把这比作他妻子作为医生的工作:“在急诊室，雷切尔一次只能帮助一个人。但我们有可能一次影响数百万人。”

***

和任何政治人物一样，纳达夫的选民分为反对者和反对者。在我任期的大部分时间里，我都是一个赞成者。当然，纳达夫可能让人难以忍受，尤其是当他谈到产品的潜力时。但你不能因为一个创始人相信自己的公司就指责他。作为领导，我尊重他。他没有听任何废话。当我刚开始工作时，他一发现我有丝毫平庸的迹象就抓住不放。“你为那次活动选择的照片，”他有一次说，指的是一张要在主页上放一天的内容，“它不符合我们的质量标准。”有了纳达夫，你总是要追求卓越。他的一些要求是微不足道的，但其他时候，它们从我身上引出了那种除非你有点害怕否则不可能的努力。他曾经让我给全公司做一个关于产品重新设计的报告。我试图摆脱它，告诉他这已经是疯狂的一周，我刚刚下来喉咙痛。我开玩笑说，如果我的情况没有改善，我可能需要用口技来做演示，希望他能明白我的暗示。“哈！”他说。“祝你好运！”

我最终将我们的产品与古希腊的*凯罗斯*联系起来。希腊人有两个表示时间的词:chronos，是流逝的时间，kairos，是必须抓住的时刻。时钟不停的滴答声就是 chronos。第二个你决定去亲吻是凯罗斯。我提出，我们的产品是关于最大化凯罗斯。个性化的地理定位推荐允许用户找到特定时刻的最佳活动。

扯淡？也许吧。但我决心把它变成我能收集到的最好的、最有条理的废话。瞧，努力工作得到了回报:每个人都他妈的喜欢它。几周后，同事们找到我，让我详细解释这个概念。就连纳达夫也对我赞不绝口。在第二个星期一的餐桌上，他告诉我，他和他的妻子整个周末都在讨论 kairos。“我很惊讶，”他告诉我，“有人能给我展示一种思考我自己公司的新方法。”

但他不打算让我晒它。一个月后，他和其他两位联合创始人退出了董事会。乔尔径直朝我走来。“我想你会很高兴听到，”他说，“Nadav 刚刚向整个董事会展示了你的 kairos 概念。”那一周，每当纳达夫经过我的办公桌时，我都试图引起他的注意，希望他能停下来告诉我关于董事会的事情。他从来没有。夸夸其谈不是纳达夫的风格，但这并不意味着他冷酷无情。事实上，他对我们最底层的员工，我们的承包商和策展人非常同情。当 Erin 觉得她更新更年轻的同事被提升时，Nadav 在晚饭后和她见了两个小时。想想看:一位首席执行官一心一意关注一名初级员工对办公室政治的担忧。

我曾经向 Nadav 吐露，我很担心我的一个直接下属的表现。她努力工作，她渴望取悦，她迷恋公司。唯一的问题是，我不认为这是一个很好的适合她的角色。我做好准备，等待 Nadav 告诉我，我必须解雇她。相反，他为她挺身而出。“这个人对我们的产品充满热情，这对我们来说是一笔财富。我们需要找到一种方法来更好地利用她的才能。”没有哪个员工资历太浅，不配拥有纳达夫的时间。当你和他交谈时，你觉得他理解了你最微妙的一点，不管他是否同意你，他都认真对待你。他倾听你的想法，除了理解别无其他目的，总是带着一个道德指南针咨询。

***

那年夏天，办公室里的气氛很紧张。创始人们正在进行 C 轮融资，花了很长时间才结束。起初，纳达夫向我们华丽地介绍了他们的进展:“我们的销售额每 10 周翻一番。我们处于筹集资金的有利地位。从长远来看，我们可以选择对我们有意义的交易。”但是这种增长是通过不可持续的方法实现的。销售额很高，但只是因为我们提供了很大的折扣。我们是奢侈品体验的市场，但用户似乎只对普通价格感兴趣。为了说服更多理想的商家加入我们的平台，我们有时会预付他们销售收入，相信我们会弥补损失。当一个活动卖不出去的时候，我们会派员工冒充真正的用户。这本来是一个临时解决方案，以防止商家猜测我们无法转移他们的库存，但该计划持续了几个月。结果，我们每个人参加的啤酒飞行和意大利面品尝菜单比大多数人一生中参加的都多。几个月后，纳达夫的筹款更新变得更加简洁。有几个星期，他忙于会见投资者，根本没有出现在我们的全体人员面前。乔尔或桑杰主持会议，你可以告诉他们没有纳达夫在那里感到尴尬。

与此同时，办公室陷入了一种僵持的格局。整个公司都需要变革——我们一直在推迟的大型基础设施投资，需要对产品做出战略决策，需要开发更好的内部工具。但在我们结束这一轮之前，不会有任何真正的事情发生。我们经常听到“筹款后”，这已经成为一种重复。最后，纳达夫带着重大消息来到了全明星赛:有人就一项战略收购与他接洽。他向我们保证，这绝不是他心目中的终极目标。但是这个特别的收购者理解我们的愿景，并且处于一个独特的位置去扩展它。这个机会太好了，不能错过。

当我们发现是谁时，我们同意了。纳达夫总是称之为“收购者”——我们只是从流言蜚语中知道是谁——是少数几家连你祖母都熟悉的科技公司之一。我不禁感到兴奋。尽管我很难看到我们产品的价值，但收购者显然看到了，这是有价值的。如果交易成功的话，我还有价值:我的股票期权。可能的收购让办公室里的人变得无精打采，但这种好心情很快就被一个不幸的意外事件浇灭了。公告发布几周后，所有承包商都被解雇了。他们大约有 10 人，就像初创企业的情况一样，他们只是名义上的合同工，与全职员工没有什么区别。我仍然假定纳达夫无罪，所以我给他发了一封电子邮件，要求他解释这个决定。他的回答:

*这完全是为了我们承包商的利益…我们没有等到知道确切的时间表，这可能会让我们辛勤工作的承包商陷入困境，而是决定为我们做一件艰难的事情，即主动让我们的承包商放松下来。我很高兴地说，我已经亲自为我们的几个承包商做了推荐人，他们现在都在或者即将接受令人兴奋的新职位。这完全是为了回应我们过去得到的巨大反馈:尽我们所能给我们的队友提供尽可能多的支持和时间，为他们未来的成功做准备。*

我把邮件给我丈夫亚伦看，他对此表示怀疑。“我不相信 Nadav 说的任何话，”他告诉我。"听起来他们需要削减成本。"也许之前经历过两次收购的亚伦是有先见之明的。或者也许纳达夫的故事是完全真实的。我还是不知道。但是，当最后一个柚子 La Croix 从饮料冷却器中消失，并且没有新的来代替它的时候，这感觉就像是亚伦对这种情况的看法的证据。

**Tuesday**.

Nadav calls a meeting after lunch. All-hands were always on Fridays, so it has to be something important.

“For a long time, I’ve wondered what this conversation would feel like,” he begins. “I never expected it to feel like this.”

He tells us that “the acquirer” called him a few days earlier and summarily pulled out of the deal. No negotiation, no explanation.

This is, to put it mildly, very bad. Once we had a signed term sheet from the acquirer, Nadav explains, we ended negotiations with all our backup options. Our investors had been keeping us afloat until the deal closed, but now that it’s off the table, there isn’t enough money to start the fundraising process all over again.

“I do have some good news,” Nadav says. He tells us that in our situation, most startups would simply shut down, leaving everyone out of a job. But the work we’d done together was too important for him to let it die that easily. Over the weekend, he reached out to everyone in the Valley he’d ever done a favor for. He sent hundreds of emails trying to find someone to rescue our company.

Plenty of the people he reached out to were interested. Some were interested in our product but not our people, others in just our engineering or business development teams. “But no matter how desperate our position, there is one thing I refuse to compromise on,” Nadav recounts. “And that’s our people. If someone wants to acquire us, they take all of us or none of us.”

Even in such trying times, Nadav remains clear eyed about what matters. “You are the ones who created our amazing product, and I value each and every one of your contributions,” he says. “That’s why I said no to a lot of otherwise attractive offers. Even if it means sacrificing what we’ve built.”

By the end of the weekend, he pulled off a miracle: “There was one company — a company that’s doing incredibly well, growing very fast, and needs people to scale up its operations — that saw this as a great opportunity. They saw great overlap between their needs and our expertise, and they’re willing to move quickly. That company is Pegasus.”

A collective sigh of letdown. Pegasus is an on-demand food delivery company. It’s nowhere near as exciting as the original acquirer.

“We will all be transitioning into new roles at Pegasus,” Nadav says. “For now, our first priority is to shut down the product as quickly and as gracefully as possible.”

Nadav stops speaking for a long, long time. He sits alone on the stool at the front of the room, crying. Finally, he says, “I did the best I could for you guys. But I never imagined it would end this way. I think the world will be a sadder place without us in it.”

Meeting adjourned.

**Wednesday**.

A group of us are taking a long, beer-soaked lunch at a brewery on the other side of town (we’re not sure what else to do) when I get an email from Bethany:

“You’ll be interviewing at Pegasus at 9am tomorrow.”

Bethany and Sanjay have made themselves available in the conference room all day. When I get back to the office, I pay them a visit. With whom will I be interviewing? For what role? Is it a casual conversation to learn more about my interests and aptitude, or really an interview?

“I’m sorry,” Sanjay tells me, “We know about as much as you do.”

**Thursday**.

The interview is with Cory, Pegasus’ head of operations. He notices the bike that I arrive on, and we bond over our shared love for the outdoors. We have a good rapport; the interview goes well.

**The following Tuesday.**

At first, Pegasus spoke to five or more of us per day, but soon the pace of interviews slows. Those who have not yet interviewed start to get worried. There is talk: maybe they aren’t really taking everyone?

On Tuesday afternoon, Reid sends a reassuring email to the team. It’s logistically challenging for Pegasus to find the time to interview 50 new employees while still running their enormously successful company, he writes. He thanks us for our patience.

**Wednesday**.

Nadav calls another all-hands for Wednesday afternoon.

“I’m sorry to have to say this,” he begins, “but after reviewing their needs and our teams’ backgrounds, Pegasus is unable to make offers to everyone. We didn’t want to put anyone in a role where they would not be set up for success.”

“Pegasus was able to extend 20 offers. For the 30 of you who did not receive offers, I will do everything in my power to help you find your next role. In a half hour, we’ll send you a calendar invite to one of two meetings where you’ll find out which group you’re in.”

“I know this isn’t the way any of us imagined this would end. I’m proud of the work we’ve all done here, and you should be too. I want us to enjoy the end of our time together, so I got a bunch of alcohol. You’ll find it all on the back table. Celebrate yourselves — you deserve it.”

Nadav buying the office alcohol: there was something awkward about it. He had always been removed from the office drinking culture — he rarely joined our happy hours, and when he did, he never got drunk. If he felt personally responsible for the way things turned out, getting the office hammered at 2pm on a weekday was an odd way of showing it.

I nurse a beer as we all mull about the office, waiting for our meeting invitations. I secretly hope that I don’t get an offer. Pegasus sounds boring. But guilt-motivated networking from three well-connected founders? That actually sounds pretty good.

Too bad: I’m invited to the smaller meeting. Reid is standing at the head of the conference room table. He knows the past week has been a whirlwind — and trust him, he says, when the original deal fell through, he was as disappointed as any of us. But during the past few days, he’s had the opportunity to meet with the Pegasus team, and he’s actually gotten excited. Pegasus isn’t just a food delivery company, he now sees. It is transforming the accessibility of cities, building the infrastructure to connect people and seamlessly move local goods.

“You know,” he says, “it’s not that different from what we were doing.”

I can see our new tagline now, someone jokes: We know we told you to go out. But why not order in?

The Pegasus executive team is coming by the office tonight at 6pm, we learn. They’re going to meet with each of us, one by one, to present our offers. Luka, the CEO, is a great guy, and Reid thinks we’ll all get along with him. “Just be yourself,” Reid says. “You’ll already have an offer letter in your hand, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.”

We exit the conference room to find our comrades who didn’t get offers approaching Nadav’s alcohol station with renewed vigor. By 4pm, there is beer pong. By 5pm, shots. No one seems particularly motivated to head out to one of the nearby bars. There is plenty to drink right here, in the office we won’t be occupying for much longer. I mostly abstain, save for a sip here and there of other people’s drinks.

Just before 6pm, Reid and Sanjay ask to speak with me. We have to walk to the little alcove at the other end of the hall for some quiet, since the office has become complete pandemonium.

“The Pegasus executive team is in the conference room,” Reid tells me. “You’re going to meet with them first.” He hands me my offer letter. I scan down to the number: more than I’m making now, but less than I had hoped.

“Is it cool if I negotiate?” I ask. “Of course,” Sanjay says. “You’ll have an opportunity to meet one-on-one with your manager about that later this week.”

I head back to the conference room, where I find six executives seated around the glass table — CEO, CTO, head of HR, head lawyer, I don’t know who else — and an empty chair at the head for me. The occasional screech can be heard on the other side of the wall, from one of the 30 employees these executives declined to hire.

I, too, feel slightly buzzed, which loosens me up just enough to want to build some rapport with Luka. After warming up with a few basic questions about the role, I address him directly: “When we first heard about this acquisition last week, most of us thought of Pegasus as just another food delivery company. But over the past few days, I’ve learned so much more and I’m truly excited to join the team. Reid was explaining earlier today how you’re all about re-imagining urban infrastructure. Tell me more.”

He does. I thank them for their time. I leave.

Later that evening, I get an email from Reid. It’s addressed to everyone who got offers. He wants us all in the office by 9am the next morning, because Pegasus didn’t end up meeting with everyone that night after all. I ask Reid if I need to come in, since I already had my meeting.

“I think it’s important that you’re there,” he writes back. “A lot of people have been skeptical about Pegasus, and your positive attitude is helpful for the rest of the office. Plus, there will be time for you to meet one-on-one with your future manager.”

**Thursday**

The 20 of us arrive on time. I ask Dimitri how things went after I left last night.

“You didn’t hear?” he says. “They met with Daron after you, but then they just left suddenly. Apparently they weren’t happy about all the drunk people who didn’t get offers still being here.”

The Pegasus team arrives around 9:30 and we gather for a presentation from Luka, who I am coming to see as Nadav’s polar opposite. Luka is German, but Nadav is the one who embodies all the German stereotypes: composed, severe, and with a machine-like consistency. Luka is a shameless douche who seems delighted to find himself at the helm of an ascendant start-up.

After Luka’s presentation, I learn that I’ll be meeting with Cory, who interviewed me, and Trish, the head of HR, to discuss my offer. In the hours before that meeting, I solicit Amir to help me research salary ranges and practice negotiating. We settle on a number that’s $15k over the initial offer and review the reasons why it’s justified.

At 1pm, Cory and Trish welcome me into the small conference room. I’m nervous, but I make my case. Trish speaks first:

“What you’ve accomplished is impressive, and I can see that while our offer was a bump, it’s a bump from a base that was well below market. If we were able to reach within 5k of what you asked for, would that be amenable to you?”

“I could definitely work with that.”

“I need to run this by Luka, but I’ll send you an updated offer letter by the end of the day. We need it signed by tomorrow noon. I look forward to working together.”

I find Amir and high-five him. I text Aaron: I did it! I text my sister: let’s go shopping! That night, I meet her in Union Square, then we bike back to her place for dinner.

“Why don’t we order from Pegasus?” I say. “To celebrate.”

After a long wait, a bike courier arrives with tepid pozole and enchiladas. In the middle of eating, my phone rings.

“Hello, Leah? This is Trish. Do you have a minute?”

“Sure,” I say, walking down the hall into my sister’s bedroom.

“I need to inform you that Pegasus is rescinding your offer.”

“What?”

“I’ll be honest with you. The reason why is that when you met with the executive team on Wednesday night, they thought you seemed inebriated. And when I discussed your salary request with Luka, he said, ‘well, she’s just not worth it.’”

“That doesn’t make any sense. Maybe I was a little flustered, given the situation, but…”

“The decision is irreversible. I’m sorry.”

In an instant I lurch from elation to humiliation. It fills me with shame to imagine that my nervousness had registered as inebriation. I think back to the meeting: did I say something inappropriate? Laugh wildly? Perhaps my face was flushed?

I text Aaron. He’s in Vancouver for work and doesn’t respond right away. I text Dimitri. He’s just taken a lot of edibles and expresses a sense of outrage on my behalf, but informs me that he’s “way too high” to be of much help. I text Nadav. I can’t reach anyone, so I pace in my sister’s bedroom alone.

A half hour later, Nadav calls. “Sanjay is on the line too,” he says. I open my mouth to speak but instead release a spate of hiccupped sobs. The crying is especially unfortunate because the last thing I want from Nadav is to be comforted. I want him to tell me how this could have happened. Nadav’s the one with the well-honed moral compass, the one who refused to entertain acquisition offers from companies that weren’t interested in his people, the one who knows I’d never walk into a room full of executives and make a fool of myself.

Instead, he says, “You’re young. This isn’t the end of your career.” (For the record, I’m seven months younger than him.)

He tells me to put a meeting on his calendar for first thing in the morning, “to discuss what we can learn from this.”

**Friday**

Nadav is running late for our meeting, and while I’m waiting for him, I find Reid. He and Sanjay were the last ones to see me before my fateful meeting with the Pegasus executives, and I ask him if he thought I seemed drunk. “Be honest,” I demand. “I can take it.”

“You were totally normal.”

Unsatisfied, I ask Amir. “Why are you even asking me that?” he says. “Of course you weren’t drunk. The people you negotiated with were in that meeting too, remember? If they thought you were drunk, would they have agreed to a higher salary the next day?”

Nadav finally arrives with Sanjay in tow, and leads us into the big conference room. I feel an unsettling intimacy between the three of us, knowing that they heard me sobbing my brains out on the phone 12 hours earlier. I cling to my morning-after composure like a shield.

“Why don’t you start by telling us exactly what you remember happening in that room,” Nadav says.

“I asked a few questions about the role, the company,” I say. “And I thanked them. That’s it.”

“That’s all that happened? You’re 100% sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure. At worst, I was a little nervous and buzzed from the beer I had earlier. I definitely wasn’t drunk.”

“Neither Sanjay or I was in the room, so all we have to go on is what we heard from Pegasus. When you were done with your meeting, they were clearly unhappy with how it went.”

“The only unusual thing about the meeting was hearing everyone else enjoying the drinks you bought for them. Maybe that colored their impression of me.”

“It’s important to take responsibility for our actions. We can all learn something from this.”

“Maybe the lesson for you is that buying alcohol for a bunch of people who just lost their jobs isn’t the best way to make a good impression on important guests you invite to the office.”

“It’s everyone’s personal choice how much they drink. I don’t think that you’re entirely blame-free here.”

“I was trying so hard to find something to blame myself for that I didn’t sleep last night. But I can’t think of anything I did that warrants this response.”

“Perhaps there is a lesson about taking these kinds of situations more seriously.”

It dawns on me that this meeting isn’t so much to help me as to ensure that I don’t derail the deal or pollute the minds of my colleagues. Sure enough, the next question Nadav asks is how I plan to share my situation with others.

“I’m not going to shit talk Pegasus,” I say. “I genuinely hope you all have a great experience there, but after the way they’ve treated me, I wouldn’t work there even if they gave me my offer back.”

“I don’t want you to walk out of here feeling that way,” Nadav says. “That’s not right.”

I tell him not to worry about it. That I’m fine with just taking my severance and moving on.

“I’m sorry, there won’t be any severance for you.”

“Wait — so everyone else gets severance but me?”

“There’s no money left. We’re literally selling the furniture.”

I get up to leave, but Nadav turns to me. “There’s something else I want to say to you,” he says, as Sanjay walks out the door.

“Despite what anyone else says,” he begins, “I still think that you are partially responsible for what happened.”

I say nothing. Nadav continues speaking. “I’m about to tell you something that I’ve never told anyone. Not my parents, not Sanjay, not even my wife. And I want you to promise me you won’t tell anyone.”

“I promise.”

“When I was your age…” it did not begin, but may well have. I won’t repeat the details of Nadav’s story, except to say that it was about the dire consequences of a gaffe he made early in his career — and how he recovered from it to achieve his current position. He offered me the tale as if it were a gift. I would have preferred severance instead.

我无能为力，所以我什么也没做。那天下午，我静静地坐着，听纳达夫发表他最后一次动情的演讲。他告诉我们，他确信我们都会继续做伟大的事情。他本人期待着在飞马公司度过下一个美好的人生。没多久我就找到了另一份工作。纳达夫兑现了他做推荐人的承诺。至于其他承诺，他并不那么可靠:在飞马公司工作三个月后，他去了更好的地方。六个月后，加入飞马座的团队剩下不到一半。

今年春天，我新公司的首席执行官在他的融资平台上寻找经验丰富的企业家的反馈。他要求介绍一下纳达夫，所以我安排我们三个人在海斯谷的一家咖啡馆见面。我静静地听着他们俩交换职业经历。

“我的第一家公司被胡利收购了，”纳达夫开始说道。“我的下一个，由帕伽索斯。现在，我是拉维加的 EIR，正在为新的冒险做准备。”

纳达夫讲述的方式，听起来像是一个平滑的轨迹。投资者花了数百万美元，30 个职业生涯被搁置，千禧一代醒来后仍然不知道今晚要做什么:一个硅谷的成功故事。有时候——通常当我和亚伦谈论这件事的时候——我会对发生的事情产生真正的愤怒。在这些时刻，我想把纳达夫拖到我的故事中，把他抓起来，把他的脸贴在上面，就像你对一只在地毯上拉屎的狗做的那样。我想让他知道他比卢卡更糟糕，至少他没有假装支持我。但是当我审视我的愤怒时，就像我现在正在做的，它在我手中分崩离析。纳达夫应该给我遣散费，当然，但真的没有钱了。他应该为我挺身而出，但我现在明白了，他的遗产取决于他向一个善变的小鬼磕头。也许他的罪责可以在故事的早期被发现；也许他被自己对一种无足轻重的产品的坚定信念蒙蔽了双眼。但大多数首席执行官都是如此。

如果不能把纳达夫塑造成令人满意的反派，谁能？天马公司善变的 CEO？收购我们失败的公司？当市场街上到处都是无家可归的人和偶尔被肢解的尸体时，年轻、单身的千禧一代想知道在哪里花钱？作为美学和伦理理想的激进透明？市场的残酷？中世纪的现代家具，沙漠靴，葡萄柚？为什么一定要有一个责备的对象——否则会落到我头上吗？我写这个故事是为了证明自己无罪吗？鉴于我的行为合理且符合惯例，我怎么会受到指责呢？也许我应该受到责备，因为我的行为是合理的，符合惯例的？

如果这个故事是一场青丝的游戏，那它就是一场漫长而孤独的游戏。我是“它”，但我的潜在受害者无处可寻，让我在黑暗中徘徊。
